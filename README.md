# ü§ù Stagehands

## Software Plan

### Front End
- Setup View
  - Draw stage boundries
    - Easy - Draw 2D boundary relative to known robot pose
    - Moderate - WebXR client that allows drawing boundary in AR using a mobile device (which requires localizing the robot relative to the mobile device)
  - Setup robots
    - Pairing to system (LAN)
    - Naming
    - Give unique LEDs
- Default view 
  - Visualization component (3D map view, by default 
    - React model of the mic stand with movable components
    - Battery icon that listens for the battery level and sends warning at 10%
  - Editable ‚ÄòPlaylist‚Äô of poses/locationsThe mapping (possibly AR)
  - Big stop button
  - Selection panel (allows you to cherry pick on a bot)
    - Detailed status
    - Virtual joystick
  
### Bridge
- Bridge
  - Serialisation of that pose for presets
  - Translation from web pose to target pose on ROS
  - Pathfinding to target pose 
  
### TurtleBot
- TurtleBot
  - Object detection while pathfinding 
  - Sending obstacle data to central server


## Usage of ROS installation script
`NOTE: The install script is only meant to work on DICE computers`
A script has been provided to prepare the DICE environment for ROS development on the turtlebot. To use the script:
- Clone your own repository and open a terminal in this repository
- Run `./install.sh` - it sets up a catkin workspace, installs dependencies, and sets up bashrc on both DICE and the Turtlebot
- After installation, you can quickly ssh into your Turtlebot with macro `turtleshell`
- You can then directly develop your packages in your repository, which already has gitignore configured to not commit builds and dependencies
