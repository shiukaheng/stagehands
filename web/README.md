# The Web App

## Installation 

The first step is to install ![node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), the backend for the project. 
Then navigate to the `web` folder and run:

```sh
npm install
```

## Developing

The homepage for the app is in the root of the `web` folder and is `index.html`.
The code/backend can be sound in the `src` folder, this is also where all of the assets and stylesheets are stored.

## Running

To run the website locally use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will give you a url you can paste into your browser which will show the website or any errors
